# E_healthcare-gesture-Based-System


This project presents the development of a Gesture-Based Patient Assistance System utilizing Python and
Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable non-verbal communication through hand gestures.

The system is designed to recognize specific hand
gestures made by the patient and translate them into predefined commands or
messages, which are then displayed or conveyed to a nurse or caregiver.

The main objective is to provide a cost-effective, contactless, and userfriendly solution that improves patient autonomy and reduces response time in
healthcare settings. The system is particularly beneficial in intensive care units
(ICUs), elder care, and situations involving speech-impaired or paralyzed
individuals

# Purpose:
 The primary purpose of the Gesture-Based Patient Assistance System is to
bridge the critical communication gap experienced by non-verbal patients, thereby
significantly enhancing their autonomy, comfort, and the overall quality of care they
receive. This project is driven by the recognition that the inability to verbally
communicate can lead to profound psychological distress, unmet needs, and potential
compromises in medical treatment.


# Installation
Just paste this command in Your Cmd prompt and let it instal the modules it want 


pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyttsx3

If you're using a virtual environment or want to ensure compatibility, you can run:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyttsx3

• Storage: Minimum 200MB is Enough.


• Webcam or HD Camera:


To capture real-time video of patient hand gestures with sufficient clarity for accurate
recognition


Software Requirements


• Operating System:


 Windows 10/11 or Linux (Ubuntu recommended for Python compatibility)

 
• Python 3.3.1+


• OpenCV


• MediaPipe


• Python Librarie
